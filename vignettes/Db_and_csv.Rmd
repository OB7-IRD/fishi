# Database / csv

The databases and csv used by fishi contain a large number of columns. To be able to use the functions, you need to provide a dataset with identical column names. Here's what they correspond to :

**activity_date** : Date of activity (boat out of service, transit, catch+ and catch+ weight, etc.). It is entered in dd/mm/yyyy format. The first record should correspond to the departure date for a trip.

**activity_id** : Numeric identifier of the activity (from 1 to n). This is the only field that can be used to differentiate one activity from another for the same day of the week. Note that an increasing range of numbers does not necessarily correspond to the chronological range.

**boat_code**: The boat's internal code (note that the same boat may have several different codes when changing flag, etc.).

**catch** : Weight of fish caught during the current activity (commercial or non-commercial species, stored in tanks or dumped at sea).

**country_code** : Code of the country

**cwp11_act** : code of the 1x1 square in which the activity is located

**fleet** : Country's fleet.

**flag** : Country's flag.

**gear** : Name for type of vessel used.

**keel_code** : Keel coding (unique throughout the ship's life).

**landing_date** : Boat landing date (dd/mm/yyyy format).

**ocean_code**: Code of the ocean in which the geographical area is located

**ocean_label** : Name of the ocean in which the geographical area is located

**port_code** : Code of the port designation (ORSTOM)

**port_label** : Name of the port designation (ORSTOM)

**positive_set**:Â total number of positive sets during the activity.

**set_duration**: set duration calculated using several parameters: fishing method, tonnage and fishing year

**school_code** : School type code.

**school_label**: Abbreviated name of school type

**species_code** : Internal species code

**total_hour_at_sea**: Total hours at sea for the activity (from 0 to 24h). Note that if several activities take place on the same date, the first will take 24h and the others 0.

**total_hour_fished**: Total hours fished during the activity (= set +search +transit etc.). Approximately 12h in OA and 13h in OI. Note that if several activities take place on the same date, the first will take the total hours and the others 0.

**total_set**: total number of sets during the activity.

**vessel_label** : Name of the ship.

**vessel_type_code** : Code for type of vessel used
